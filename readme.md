# Video Producing standards

# Final Cut Pro

## Libraries

- Make separate libraries for each different video project.
- Don't copy the video asset files into the project
- Keep the files linked to the video assets folder
- Relink files as needed

### Projects

- Use automatic settings but ensure the first clip added to the project is the best (eg. 4k 60fps, etc)
- Apply crossfade transition at start and end of all private videos and any changes to different clips on the timeline.
- Apply the RLtemplate to youtube videos by copying and pasting to the timeline and then editing the video from there.
- Tag or add metadata to clips to aid with multicam clip creation or big projects etc.
- Add any clips into multicam clips
- Apply 'GoPro Wide' colour correction to any go pro 7 clips.

### Renders

- Always render using preset HEVC Full bitrate.
